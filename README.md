# Hospital Management System Project Description

#Overview
The Hospital Management System (HMS) is a comprehensive software solution designed to streamline the operations and management of a hospital. This system facilitates efficient handling of patient information, doctor details, and appointment scheduling, ensuring smooth and effective healthcare service delivery.

#Database Design
The HMS database comprises three primary tables: Patients, Doctors, and Appointments. These tables are interconnected through foreign keys to maintain relational integrity and support efficient data retrieval.

#Patients Table

PatientID: An integer serving as the primary key to uniquely identify each patient.
Name: The patient's full name, stored as a string of up to 50 characters.
Age: The age of the patient.
Gender: The patient's gender, stored as a string.
Contact: The contact number of the patient.
